# COL106-Assignment2
Second Assignment of COL106 at IITD.
File TreeNode:
A single node is used to implement the tree and the binary search tree as well.
Hence no need for a link pointer to connect information from both trees since they are different attributes of the same node.
An (inbuilt) ArrayList is used to store children of a node.
searchParent, leftchild, rightchild are attributes for the Binary Search Tree.
Proper Constructors, Access Methods, Boolean returning methods and Update Methods are defined for manipulating TreeNode class.
File Tree:
The tree is defined which contains information of the heirarchy as well the Binary Search Tree.
Using an inbuilt queue to implement printEmployees in O(n).
Insert and Delete are same standard algorithms as taught in class.
